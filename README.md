<h3>‚ö°Description</h3></br>
This project is meant to show case various professionals and their information according to their sectors. If you are interested in a professional you also have the opportunity to contact the professional via e-mail.
It is divided into the admin and user sides. The admin only can add professionals and must sign-in before. You register admins directly in the data base. We used local storage in this project. The user can navigate freely through the app except on professionals management. </br>
